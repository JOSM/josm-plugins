PURPOSE
-------
This plugin allows to import the proprietary CSV format used by the Columbus V-900 data logger.

Two modes are supported
a) 	Simple mode (default)
b) 	Professional or extended mode - logs additional GPS values like VDOP, HDOP, Fixing. This can 
	be accomplished by putting a file named config.txt onto the microSD card shipped with the V-900
	logger. The contents of my file looks as follows:
	
	--- BEGIN config.txt ---
	1,000,001,
	notes:
	1 Professional mode
	000 Over-speed tag 
	001 Spy mode timer	
	--- END config.txt ---
	
	Please refer to the manual for details.

Way points and tracks are transformed into the GPX format. Way points may be either plain position entries or
may reference an audio file recorded during the logging session. In this case, the way point shows up with
a flag - pressing it play the recorded audio.



OPTIONS
-------
This plugin offers some options predominately to change the import behavior. All settings are accessible via the
JOSM preferences dialog and starts with the prefix 'columbuscsv'. 

The options are
* Show summary after import (Boolean), default: true
* Ignore audio files (Boolean), default: false
* Ignore hdop/vdop/pdop entries (Boolean), default: false
* Warn on missing audio files (Boolean), default: true
* Warn on conversion errors (Boolean), default: true
	
I hope that this plugin is useful.
