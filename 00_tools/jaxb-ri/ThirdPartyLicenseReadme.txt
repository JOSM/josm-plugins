Use of any of this software is governed by the terms of the license below:

The "Artistic License"

				Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

	"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
	created through textual modification.

	"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
	of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

	"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
	copyrights for the package.

	"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
	this Package.

	"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
	as a market that must bear the fee.)

	"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
	under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
following:

    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
    to get the Standard Version.

    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications.

    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
interpreter is so embedded.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
Package.

7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
regression tests for the language.

8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
construed as a distribution of this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

1.13. "You" (or "Your") means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
under, and complying with all of the terms of, this Agreement or a future
version of this Agreement issued under Section 6.1. For legal entities,
"You" includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with You. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (a)
the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty
percent (50%) of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.

2.0  SOURCE CODE LICENSE.

2.1. Copyright Grant.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
hereby grants You a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Covered Code of such Contributor, if any,
and such derivative works, in Source Code and Executable form.

2.2.  Patent Grant.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
hereby grants You a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license
under the Patent Claims to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
transfer the Covered Code prepared and provided by such Contributor, if any,
in Source Code and Executable form. This patent license shall apply to the
Covered Code if, at the time a Modification is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Modification causes such combination to be covered by the
Patent Claims. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Modification.

2.3.  Conditions to Grants.  You understand that although each Contributor
grants the licenses to the Covered Code prepared by it, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent
or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor
disclaims any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based
on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition
to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume
sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed,
if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
You to distribute Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that
license before distributing such code.

2.4.  Contributors’ Representation.  Each Contributor represents that
to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in the Covered Code it
provides , if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3.0  DISTRIBUION RESTRICTIONS.

3.1. Application of Agreement.

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
by the terms of this Agreement, including without limitation Section 2.0. The
Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of
this Agreement or a future version of this Agreement released under Section
6.1, and You must include a copy of this Agreement with every copy of the
Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
Agreement or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an
additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.3.

3.2. Description of Modifications.

You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date
of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification
is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by BEA and
including the name of BEA in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in
an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

3.3. Required Notices.

You must duplicate the following notice in each file of the Source Code:

“(c) 2002, 2003 BEA Systems, Inc.  All rights Reserved.  The contents
of this file are subject to the BEA Streaming API for XML Specification
Reference Implementation License Agreement (the “Agreement”); you may
not use this file except in compliance with the Agreement. A copy of the
Agreement is available at http://www.bea.com/”

If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a
Contributor to the copyright portion of the notice above. You must also
duplicate this Agreement in any documentation for the Source Code where You
describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You
may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However,
You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of BEA or any
other Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
hereby agree to indemnify BEA and every other Contributor for any liability
incurred by BEA or such other Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.4. Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may choose to distribute Covered Code in Executable form under its own
license agreement, provided that:

	(a) You comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

(b) Your license agreement:  (i)  effectively disclaims on behalf of all
Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties
or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; (ii)
effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages,
including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages,
such as lost profits; (iii) states that any provisions which differ from this
Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;
and (iv)  states that Source Code for the Covered Code is available from
such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

(c) You do not use any marks, brands or logos associated with the
JCP Specification, or otherwise promote or market any Covered Code, as
being compatible, compliant, conformant  or otherwise consistent with the
Specification unless such product passes, in accordance with the documentation
(including the TCK Users Guide, if any), the most current TCK applicable to
the latest version of the Specification and available from BEA one hundred
twenty (120) days before FCS of such version of the product; provided,
however, that if You elect to use a version of the TCK also provided by
BEA that is newer than that which is required under this Section 2.1(b)(v),
then You agree to pass such TCK.

3.5.  Distribution of Source Code Versions.

When You make Covered Code available in Source Code form:

	(a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

	(b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
	Covered Code.

You may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
Covered Code.  Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of
its contribution to the Covered Code, if any, in a manner that reasonably
allows subsequent licensees to identify the originator of each portion of
the Covered Code.



4.0  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE,
FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED
CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT BEA OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR)
ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO
USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

5.0  TERMINATION.

5.1. This Agreement and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to
the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination
of this Agreement. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
beyond the termination of this Agreement shall survive.

5.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
(excluding declaratory judgment actions) against BEA or a Contributor
(BEA or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
"Participant") alleging that:

(a) such Participant's Covered Code directly or indirectly infringes any
patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under
Sections 2.0of this Agreement shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice
You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable
reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by
such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
the Covered Code against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a
reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in
writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights
granted by Participant to You under Section 2.0 automatically terminate at
the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Covered
Code, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted
to You by such Participant under Sections 2.0 are revoked effective as of
the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications
made by that Participant.

5.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
that such Participant's Covered Code directly or indirectly infringes any
patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior
to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value
of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.0 shall be taken
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

5.4. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end
user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have
been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
shall survive termination.

6.0  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOUBEA, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR
ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software"
and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used
in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End

hereof. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable,
such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. This Agreement shall be governed by California law provisions
(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business
in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this Agreement
shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California,
with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation,
court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application
of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
