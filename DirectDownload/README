DirectDownload plugin for JOSM
==============================

The DirectDownload plugin enables you to directly download your GPX 
tracks you previously uploaded on openstreetmap.org without having
to download them manually first and then having to open the downloaded
track using the "Open file ..." dialog.

The plugin provides a new entry "Download track ..." in the GPS
menu (no keyboard shortcut yet). This opens a dialog that will
present a list of your uploaded tracks, showing the tracks timestamp
and filename, from which you can directly pick one track to be
downloaded into a new GPX layer.

TODO
====

* keyboard shortcut?
* properly parse track timestamp, show it in local time instead of UTC
* progress bars 
* sort tracks by time (what gets back from the /user/gpx_files API call
  does not seem to be fully sorted)
* make the table in the dialog sortable (right now when enabling auto 
  sort on the JTable object an exception is thrown when clicking
  column headers)
* show track tags
* code cleanup
