jrenderpgsql
------------

This is a modified version of "jrender".

Instead of loading .osm files from a pre-defined directory structure
like "jrender" does, this program issues an SQL query and fetches
seamark data from PostGIS, where it is expected to have been imported
with a standard osm2pgsql import using the "--hstore" flag.

It then generates an XML document from the PostGIS data which is
good enough to be processed by the S57 library routines as usual.


BUILDING
--------

You might have to adapt some paths in the build.xml for the PostGIS
and PostgreSQL JDBC drivers to be found.


RUNNING
-------

java -jar jrenderpgsql.jar "jdbc:postgresql:///mydatabae?user=myuser&password=mypassword" 14 8663 5304 tile.png 

Optional command line flags --debug (outputs the OSM XML), 
and --tilesize and --scale (use --tilesize 512 --scale 2.0 
for "retina" tiles)


STATUS
------

Seems to work at least for z12 and larger, but has received little 
testing.
