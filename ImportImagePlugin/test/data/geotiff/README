		GeoTIFF Samples
		===============

The following directories contain GeoTIFF samples from a variety of
sources.  Just because a file is in this tree does not imply that
it follows the standard correctly, or should be considered an 
example of good practice.  However, a reader that aims for flexibility
would be well advised to try and handle virtually all these files
gracefully. 

Most of the TIFF files have an .lgo file associated with them.  This
is the output of listgeo for that file.  This includes the normalized
form of the underlying projection and when possible the corners
reprojected into lat/long.  The reprojection output of listgeo should
not be considered authoritative.  If you believe that the reprojected
results for any of the files is wrong, please contact me.  

Over time I intend to prepare a set of samples which can be considered
``best practice'', and which can be used as authoritative examples. 
Any assistance in this task would be appreciated.

If you have additional samples you would like to submit to this archive
please contact me at warmerda@home.com (or warmerda@remotesensing.org).
