The following images are GeoTIFF samples.  These are SPOT Imagery
data of downtown Chicago, IL (USA) at 10 meter resolution.  
There are two GeoTIFF images as follows:

SP27GTIF TIF   652094  bytes  
UTM2GTIF TIF   650463  bytes 

One is in State Plane NAD 1927 projected coordinate systems.
The Other is in Universal Transverse Mercator proj coord system.

These were constructed using the following GeoTIFF parser metadata files:

SP27GTIF TXT      732  bytes
UTM2GTIF TXT      729  bytes

These TXT files are in the format compliant with Niles Ritter's
"LibGeoTIFF" parsing software. 

For your reference, I included two of the SPOT "GeoSPOT" format 
header files to provide more information about these images. 
This is all ASCII readable and provided just for reference, in
case you need to see what we intended the GeoTIFF images to contain.

These images have been enhanced by contrast optimization and a light
Laplace spatial filter.  So, you should be able to see them immediately
without further processing, in your display environment.  If you can't
see them right away, it's not because they need stretching or brightening
but probably there is a problem with the display software. 

Please contact me if you have questions about these images or
their attributes.   My name is Mike Ruth, and the following
