About these files:

These are USGS Image digital elevation model datasets,
reprocessed by SPOT and stored in GeoTIFF georeferenced 
format. A valid GeoTIFF 1.0 reader should be able to 
handle any of these files (assuming they can handle 
16-bit pixels), without any further metadata. 

The ".txt" files give a metadata dump of the 
corresponding. ".tif" datasets.  The only difference between 
the "m" files and the "i" files is byte-order, which 
valid TIFF readers should be able to handle on the fly. 

The 16-bit GeoTIFF files are made by Dr. Niles Ritter of 
NASA-JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) from inputs provided 
by SPOT Image Corporation.  These files are available for
public examination, demonstration, or other support
of the GeoTIFF format.
