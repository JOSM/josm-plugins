Readme for my plugin:

Usability:

Plugin NameManager should be used in situations where user is forced to put/modify/delete a big amount of tags to objects placed in selected area.
Example:
I have mapped a small town and figured that every highway and building should have addr:cityname tag with proper value. Solution is simple. I use NameManager which automatically put those tags to the objects.

Interface:

Plugin has three tabs:
Add/Modify - for adding tags or (when tags with the given key already exists) for modifying tags.
Delete - for deleting tags with the given key.
Administrative - for putting administrative tags to objects. This functionality was developed by the demand of the Harman/Becker Automotive Systems. By this tab user can put administrative tags, such as districts, states etc. regarding to selected country.

How can I use NameManager?

To use NameManager user should select closed way (it could be the temporary way drawn just for usage of the plugin) and select NameManage from the Tools Menu.
