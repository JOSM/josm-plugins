This plugin can be useful when you are improving accuracy of the ways that have already been mapped before.
It can be useful when you are improving accuracy of the ways that have already been mapped before.
The idea of the plugin is to substitute dragging and dropping nodes with clicking to quicken the editing process.



How to use the plugin:

Before you begin: Make sure you have a high-resolution imagery or enough GPS traces below your data layer.

1. Select a way you want to work on.

2. Click on the “Improve Way Accuracy” button on the left panel to enter a special editing mode.

3. To move nodes that already exist:
     Click on the map where you think a node should be. The highlighted (nearest) node will be moved there.

   To create new nodes:
     Press and hold Ctrl button and click on the map. A new node will split the segment that is the closest to the cursor.

4. To start working on a different way without leaving the mode, unselect current way by pressing Esc and click on another one.



Tips:

   The plugin automatically finds segments and nodes that are the closest to the cursor.
   However, if you want to get more flexibility, you can lock the highlighted node/segment when moving a mouse.
   Press and hold Shift or left mouse button and the focused node or segment will be kept the same no matter where you move the cursor.

   JOSM has a wireframe view that turns off any styles and makes lines very thin. You can try it by pressing Ctrl+W.
   It might be a good idea to toggle that view before improving ways accuracy as it allows
   to see the imagery below the data layer in a much better way.
