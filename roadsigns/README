    Basically, this plugin is a port to Java and the JOSM (plugin) framework.

    Pics for the German preset have been derived from

JavaCC usage:
-------------

There is a simple format to insert parameters into strings. E.g. keys,
values and refs in the preset file can contain '$foo' or '${foo}' which
will be replaced by the value of the parameter named foo.
(Textual "$" or "\" is escaped as "\$" or "\\".)

javacc is used for easier tokenization. All *.java files in the folder
plugins/roadsigns/javacc are auto generated. To create them, execute

    javacc ParamString.jj

(Provided javacc is installed. Not necessary if that file is not changed.)
