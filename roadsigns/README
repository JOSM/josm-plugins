Road Signs Plugin
=================

Shows a GUI dialog to tag objects by clicking on road sign symbols.
It tries to generate the corresponding tags for the object.
As tagging schemes are under constant development, the definitions
need to be updated when needed.

    Basically, this plugin is a port to Java and the JOSM (plugin) framework.

JavaCC usage:
-------------

There is a simple format to insert parameters into strings. E.g. keys,
values and refs in the preset file can contain '$foo' or '${foo}' which
will be replaced by the value of the parameter named foo.
(Textual "$" or "\" is escaped as "\$" or "\\".)

javacc is used for easier tokenization. All *.java files in the folder
plugins/roadsigns/javacc are auto generated. To create them, execute

    javacc ParamString.jj

(Provided javacc is installed. Not necessary if that file is not changed.)
