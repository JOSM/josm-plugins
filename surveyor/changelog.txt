2007-08-05: added BeepAction. Parameter is number of beeps

2007-08-02: PlayAudioAction is able to read wav files from classpath and from urls
            
            It also plays the audio file in the background, so the PlayAudioAction can
            be set as the first action without delaying the setting of the waypoint/nodes
            by a following SetWaypointAction.
