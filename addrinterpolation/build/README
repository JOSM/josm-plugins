Address Interpolation Plugin


The Address Interpolation described in the Karlsruhe Schema allows marking 
many house addresses with minimal effort. While JOSM has a preset to assist 
with creating the key, there are several steps required to create each 
address interpolation way. This plugin combines the steps into one screen 
for ease of use and to minimize chances for error.
