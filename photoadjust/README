Photo Adjust Plugin

Author: holgermappt
License: GPL v2 or later (see below for resource licenses)


The photo adjust plugin allows to move geotagged photos on the map and
to place photos that don't have GPS coordinates associated with them
on the map, thus to geotag them.


See i18n/README for plugin translation.
