The way selector plugin allows easy selection of sequential ways that
have been divided into segments.

Created by Marko Mäkelä for selecting the mainland natural=coastline
within an area without selecting any islands.  Thanks to Harry Wood
for the way downloader plugin, which was a useful resource for learning.

Usage: Select one or more ways and activate the plugin from the Tools
menu or by the keyboard shortcut.  The selection of each selected way
will be extended until the non-branching sequence of ways ends.  You
may select one or more ways at the branches and activate the plugin
again, until you have selected all the desired ways.

When this plugin is activated, the selection may include other
primitives than ways.  This plugin only operates on the selected ways.
