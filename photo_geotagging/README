This plugin is used to write latitude and longitude information
to the EXIF header of jpg files.
It extends the core geoimage feature of JOSM by adding a new entry
to the right click menu of any image layer.

The real work (writing lat/lon values to file) is done by the pure Java
sanselan library.

Note: Although sanselan is a proper apache commons project, there was not much activity recently (End of 2009). So let's hope, it is stable enough and gets fixed, if necessary.
