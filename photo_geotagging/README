This plugin is used to write latitude and longitude information to the EXIF 
header of jpg files. It extends the core geoimage feature of JOSM by adding a 
new entry to the right click menu of any image layer.

The real work (writing lat/lon values to file) is done by the pure Java
sanselan library. Although sanselan is a proper apache commons project, there
was not much activity recently (End of 2009). The externals definition is set
to a specific revision. When updating that revision, you should check if the
workarounds (SanselanFixes.java) are still needed.
