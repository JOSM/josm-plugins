A plugin for JOSM that can query any WMS server for background images.
Also supports Metacarta's map rectifier.
Supersedes the "Landsat" plugin, as the WMS plugin can do everything the
landsat plugin could plus more.

See also utils/ywms for a way to get Yahoo satellite images with this
plugin (Linux required for ywms).
