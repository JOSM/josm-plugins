FAQ
===
* How can I check in my own plugin?
  
  - You need an account for the plugin subversion repository, see
    https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/DevelopersGuide/DevelopingPlugins#ManagingaplugininpluginSVN
  
  - Make sure to check out the tree https://josm.openstreetmap.de/osmsvn/applications/editors/josm/
        svn checkout https://josm.openstreetmap.de/osmsvn/applications/editors/josm/
    
    This will also check out the JOSM source from https://josm.openstreetmap.de/svn.
        
    Note that the build environment is not complete if you check out 
    https://josm.openstreetmap.de/osmsvn/applications/editors/josm/plugins/ only.
        
  - Create your own plugin directory. You may create a copy of the template directory
    according to '00_plugin_dir_template'.
    
* How can I build my plugin?
  
  - Update build.xml in your plugin directory and run 'ant dist' 
  
  - You may also add your plugin to 'plugins/build.xml'
   
    <target name="dist" depends="compile">
        ....
        <ant antfile="build.xml" target="dist" dir="YourPluginDir"/>
    </target>

    <target name="clean">
        ....
        <ant antfile="build.xml" target="clean" dir="YourPluginDir"/>
    </target>


* How can I make my plugin available to other JOSM users?
  
  - The manifest of your plugin jar has to include the required meta information,
    see https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/DevelopingPlugins.
    'build.xml' copied from '00_plugin_dir_template' will create a compliant manifest
    file for your plugin.
    
  - Check in your plugin jar into 'dist'. You have to do it manually. 
    There is no automatic build process. See also '00_plugin_dir_template/REAME'.
