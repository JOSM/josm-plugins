The TagEditor plugin provides an alternative to the built-in dialogs
for editing tags in JOSM.

Its main features are:
- can be launched from the "Edit" menu or using the shortcut 'T' 
  (mouseless operation)

- provides a spreadsheet-like editor for tag keys and tag values  

- improved auto completion for tag keys and tag values. Distinguishes
  between "official" OSM values and "non-official" values from the currently
  edited OSM data set. Also considers whether the current selection includes
  nodes or ways.

- displays a list of reasonable values for a tag key or a tag value in the
  current context
  
- mouseless operation. A typical editor scenario:
   * press 'T' to launch the editor
   * enter a tag key and press 'TAB' or 'ENTER' to navigate to the next cell
   * enter a tag value and press 'TAB' or 'ENTER' to navigate to the next cell
     (which creates a new tag)
     ...
   * press 'Ctrl ENTER' to apply the tags to the currently selected OSM
     primitives and close the editor 
     
- provides a searchable, tabular list of JOSM presets 
- provides a searchable, tabular list of "official" OSM features (key/value-pairs)
