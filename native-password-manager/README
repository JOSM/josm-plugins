Native Password Manager Plugin
==============================

Prevents JOSM from saving passwords as plain text to the JOSM preferences file. Instead, uses a password manager to store the data in encrypted form.
Supported password managers are gnome-keyring and KWallet. Apple Keychain and Windows data encryption may work, but are untested so far.

The following preference keys are managed:
    osm-server.username         // API login username
    osm-server.password         // API login password
    proxy.user                  // Proxy username
    proxy.pass                  // Proxy password
    oauth.access-token.key      // OAuth key
    oauth.access-token.secret   // OAuth secret

The keyring code from the Netbeans project is used to access the individual Password Managers. It is slightly patched, to remove Netbeans
specific dependencies. 

Original code:

Patch:
    netbeans-keyring-patches.diff
