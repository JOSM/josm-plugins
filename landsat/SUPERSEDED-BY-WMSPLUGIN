The landsat plugin is not developed any further. It has been superseded by
the WMSplugin which can access landsat and other WMS sources.

The WMSplugin is slightly different in usage; it does not show an extra
download checkbox in the download dialog, but instead has a new menu ("WMS")
from which you can select a download source. The download is always done 
for the currently visible bounding box.
