======
This plugin provides parts of the GeoTools library for JOSM plugins.
    * Licensed under GPL v3 (see LICENSE)

The current embedded version of GeoTools is 10.3.

However, due to major breaking changes in shapefile implementation in 10.x branch,
gt-shapefile-old-10.3.jar is bundled instead of gt-shapefile-10.3.jar to avoid
compilation issues in opendata plugin.

The switch shapefile -> shapefile-ng must be made in the same time as opendata.
