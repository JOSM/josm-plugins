Navigator plugin for JOSM

This plugin provides navigation functionality (autorouting) for josm.

It depends on the jgrapht library so this library needs to be installed in josm's plugin
directory as well!

Use the navigator mode and click all nodes that should be navigated to.
Use the middle mouse button to remove the selected nodes.
