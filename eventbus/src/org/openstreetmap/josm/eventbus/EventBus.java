/**
 * Dispatches events to listeners, and provides ways for listeners to register themselves.
 *
 * <p>The EventBus allows publish-subscribe-style communication between components without requiring
 * the components to explicitly register with one another (and thus be aware of each other). It is
 * designed exclusively to replace traditional Java in-process event distribution using explicit
 * registration. It is <em>not</em> a general-purpose publish-subscribe system, nor is it intended
 * for interprocess communication.
 *
 * <h2>Receiving Events</h2>
 *
 * <p>To receive events, an object should:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Expose a public method, known as the <i>event subscriber</i>, which accepts a single
 *       argument of the type of event desired;
 *   <li>Mark it with a {@link Subscribe} annotation;
 *   <li>Pass itself to an EventBus instance's {@link #register(Object)} method.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Posting Events</h2>
 *
 * <p>To post an event, simply provide the event object to the {@link #post(Object)} method. The
 * EventBus instance will determine the type of event and route it to all registered listeners.
 *
 * <p>Events are routed based on their type &mdash; an event will be delivered to any subscriber for
 * any type to which the event is <em>assignable.</em> This includes implemented interfaces, all
 * superclasses, and all interfaces implemented by superclasses.
 *
 * <p>When {@code post} is called, all registered subscribers for an event are run in sequence, so
 * subscribers should be reasonably quick. If an event may trigger an extended process (such as a
 * database load), spawn a thread or queue it for later. (For a convenient way to do this, use an
 * {@link AsyncEventBus}.)
 *
 * <h2>Subscriber Methods</h2>
 *
 * <p>Event subscriber methods must accept only one argument: the event.
 *
 * <p>Subscribers should not, in general, throw. If they do, the EventBus will catch and log the
 * exception. This is rarely the right solution for error handling and should not be relied upon; it
 * is intended solely to help find problems during development.
 *
 * <p>The EventBus guarantees that it will not call a subscriber method from multiple threads
 * simultaneously, unless the method explicitly allows it by bearing the {@link
 * AllowConcurrentEvents} annotation. If this annotation is not present, subscriber methods need not
 * worry about being reentrant, unless also called from outside the EventBus.
 *
 * <h2>Dead Events</h2>
 *
 * <p>If an event is posted, but no registered subscribers can accept it, it is considered "dead."
 * To give the system a second chance to handle dead events, they are wrapped in an instance of
 * {@link DeadEvent} and reposted.
 *
 * <p>If a subscriber for a supertype of all events (such as Object) is registered, no event will
 * ever be considered dead, and no DeadEvents will be generated. Accordingly, while DeadEvent
 * extends {@link Object}, a subscriber registered to receive any Object will never receive a
 * DeadEvent.
 *
 * <p>This class is safe for concurrent use.
 *
 * <p>See the Guava User Guide article on <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained">{@code EventBus}</a>.
