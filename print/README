PREFERENCES
===========

print.map-scale (integer):
The map scale x as in 1:x.
Default: 25.000

print.attribution (string): 
The attribution text which will be printed on the page.
Default: OSM Map data (c) OpenStreetMap contributors, CC-BY-SA

print.resolution.dpi (integer):
The resolution in dpi which will be used for printing. 
While a typical screen may have ~100 dpi, most printers offer a much 
higher resolution. With a higher print resolution, lines will be finer,
but icons and text will be smaller and might become unreadable.
Default: 100

print.preview.enabled (boolean):
If true, the map will be rendered as a preview in the print dialog.
If false, the preview only indicates the page area which will be filled 
by the map.
Default: false

print.saved-prefs...:
Not really user preferences, but a mechanism to reliable backup and 
restore mappaint preferences which are temporary modified for printing.
