== BETA ==

- Draw icons for multipoly settings menu
- Solve width problem for narrows buttons when "fix" and "download" appear simultaneously
- Doubleclick on a relation list member should either select a relation or
  open relation editor for that relation (and choose it) (preferences?)
- Add "Open editor" to relation context menu
- "Reverse multipolygon": create a closed area out of outer members, move tags, delete relation and empty ways
- Remove "single multipolygon" from relation settings, there will be single relation in all cases

== NEW ALGORITHM ==

- Implement algorithm to construct rings from selection
- Classify those rings (inner/outer) based on node tracing
- Break touching rings of multipolygons
- Analyze chosen relation and display corresponding symbol next to its name
- Make chosen relation name pretty (or analyze all relations in relation list)
- Sort relation members button (now it's just role fixer)
- "Add members" should search for connecting nodes among already present members
- Automatic role setting for new multipolygon ways (construct rings, see where a way goes)

== RELEASE ==

- Construct rings using middle points of ways and break those ways
- Convert adjacing rings that need to be broken to multipolygons
- Option to autodownload all ways that are being broken
