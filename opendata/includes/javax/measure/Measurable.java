/**
 * <p> This interface represents the measurable, countable, or comparable 
 *     property or aspect of a thing.</p>
 *     
 * <p> Implementing instances are typically the result of a measurement:[code]
 *         Measurable<Mass> weight = Measure.valueOf(180.0, POUND);
 *     [/code]
 *     They can also be created from custom classes:[code]
 *     class Delay implements Measurable<Duration> {
 *          private long nanoSeconds; // Implicit internal unit.
 *          public double doubleValue(Unit<Velocity> unit) { ... }
 *          public long longValue(Unit<Velocity> unit) { ... }
 *     }
 *     Thread.wait(new Delay(24, HOUR)); // Assuming Thread.wait(Measurable<Duration>) method.
 *     [/code]</p>
 *     
 * <p> Although measurable instances are for the most part scalar quantities; 
 *     more complex implementations (e.g. vectors, data set) are allowed as 
 *     long as an aggregate magnitude can be determined. For example:[code]
 *     class Velocity3D implements Measurable<Velocity> {
 *          private double x, y, z; // Meter per seconds.
 *          public double doubleValue(Unit<Velocity> unit) { ... } // Returns vector norm.
 *          ... 
 *     }
 *     class Sensors<Q extends Quantity> extends Measure<double[], Q> {
 *          public doubleValue(Unit<Q> unit) { ... } // Returns median value. 
 *          ...
 *     } [/code]</p>
