 * <p> This interface represents any type of quantitative properties or

 * <p> Distinct quantities have usually different physical dimensions; although 
 *     it is not required nor necessary, for example {@link Torque} and 
 *     {@link Energy} have same dimension but are of different nature 
 *     (vector for torque, scalar for energy).</p>
