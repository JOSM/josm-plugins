Classes to build JDOM documents from various sources.  The most common builder
class is SAXBuilder which constructs a JDOM document using a SAX parser and
can pull content from files, streams, sockets, readers, and so on.  It can use
any underlying SAX parser to handle the parsing chores.  SAXHandler provides
support for SAXBuilder.  DOMBuilder lets you build from a pre-existing DOM
tree.
