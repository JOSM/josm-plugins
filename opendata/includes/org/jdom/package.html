Classes to represent the components of an XML document.  The Verifier is a
special class useful in ensuring well-formedness of documents.  The Parent
interface is implemented by Document and Element exposing their commonality.
The Content abstract class is extended by all the node types of a document
except Document itself.

The JDOMFactory interface and DefaultJDOMFactory standard implementation
provide advanced users with the ability to create subtypes of the org.jdom
classes.
