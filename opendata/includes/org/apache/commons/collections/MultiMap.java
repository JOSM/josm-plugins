/** 
 * Defines a map that holds a collection of values against each key.
 * <p>
 * A <code>MultiMap</code> is a Map with slightly different semantics.
 * Putting a value into the map will add the value to a Collection at that key.
 * Getting a value will return a Collection, holding all the values put to that key.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * <pre>
 * MultiMap mhm = new MultiHashMap();
 * mhm.put(key, "A");
 * mhm.put(key, "B");
 * mhm.put(key, "C");
 * Collection coll = (Collection) mhm.get(key);</pre>
 * <p>
 * <code>coll</code> will be a collection containing "A", "B", "C".
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Additional methods were added to this interface in Commons Collections 3.1.
 * These were added solely for documentation purposes and do not change the interface
 * as they were defined in the superinterface <code>Map</code> anyway.
