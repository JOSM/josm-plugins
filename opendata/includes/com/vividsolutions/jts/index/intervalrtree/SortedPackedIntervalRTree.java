/**
 * A static index on a set of 1-dimensional intervals,
 * using an R-Tree packed based on the order of the interval midpoints.
 * It supports range searching,
 * where the range is an interval of the real line (which may be a single point).
 * A common use is to index 1-dimensional intervals which 
 * are the projection of 2-D objects onto an axis of the coordinate system.
 * <p>
 * This index structure is <i>static</i> 
 * - items cannot be added or removed once the first query has been made.
 * The advantage of this characteristic is that the index performance 
 * can be optimized based on a fixed set of items.
