/**
 * An <code>BinTree</code> (or "Binary Interval Tree")
 * is a 1-dimensional version of a quadtree.
 * It indexes 1-dimensional intervals (which may
 * be the projection of 2-D objects on an axis).
 * It supports range searching
 * (where the range may be a single point).
 * This structure is dynamic - 
 * new items can be added at any time,   
 * and it will support deletion of items 
 * (although this is not currently implemented).
 * <p>
 * This implementation does not require specifying the extent of the inserted
 * items beforehand.  It will automatically expand to accomodate any extent
 * of dataset.
 * <p>
 * The bintree structure is used to provide a primary filter
 * for interval queries.  The query() method returns a list of
 * all objects which <i>may</i> intersect the query interval.
 * Note that it may return objects which do not in fact intersect.
 * A secondary filter is required to test for exact intersection.
 * Of course, this secondary filter may consist of other tests besides
 * intersection, such as testing other kinds of spatial relationships.
 * <p>
 * This index is different to the Interval Tree of Edelsbrunner
 * or the Segment Tree of Bentley.
 *
 * @version 1.7
