/**
 * A ring of {@link DirectedEdge}s which may contain nodes of degree > 2.
 * A <tt>MaximalEdgeRing</tt> may represent two different spatial entities:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a single polygon possibly containing inversions (if the ring is oriented CW)
 * <li>a single hole possibly containing exversions (if the ring is oriented CCW)
 * </ul>
 * If the MaximalEdgeRing represents a polygon,
 * the interior of the polygon is strongly connected.
 * <p>
 * These are the form of rings used to define polygons under some spatial data models.
 * However, under the OGC SFS model, {@link MinimalEdgeRing}s are required.
 * A MaximalEdgeRing can be converted to a list of MinimalEdgeRings using the
 * {@link #buildMinimalRings() } method.
 *
 * @version 1.7
