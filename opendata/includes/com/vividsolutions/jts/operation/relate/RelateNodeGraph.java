/**
 * Implements the simple graph of Nodes and EdgeEnd which is all that is
 * required to determine topological relationships between Geometries.
 * Also supports building a topological graph of a single Geometry, to
 * allow verification of valid topology.
 * <p>
 * It is <b>not</b> necessary to create a fully linked
 * PlanarGraph to determine relationships, since it is sufficient
 * to know how the Geometries interact locally around the nodes.
 * In fact, this is not even feasible, since it is not possible to compute
 * exact intersection points, and hence the topology around those nodes
 * cannot be computed robustly.
 * The only Nodes that are created are for improper intersections;
 * that is, nodes which occur at existing vertices of the Geometries.
 * Proper intersections (e.g. ones which occur between the interior of line segments)
 * have their topology determined implicitly, without creating a Node object
 * to represent them.
