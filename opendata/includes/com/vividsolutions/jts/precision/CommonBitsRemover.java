/**
 * Removes common most-significant mantissa bits 
 * from one or more {@link Geometry}s.
 * <p>
 * The CommonBitsRemover "scavenges" precision 
 * which is "wasted" by a large displacement of the geometry 
 * from the origin.  
 * For example, if a small geometry is displaced from the origin 
 * by a large distance, 
 * the displacement increases the significant figures in the coordinates, 
 * but does not affect the <i>relative</i> topology of the geometry.  
 * Thus the geometry can be translated back to the origin 
 * without affecting its topology.
 * In order to compute the translation without affecting 
 * the full precision of the coordinate values, 
 * the translation is performed at the bit level by
 * removing the common leading mantissa bits.
 * <p>
 * If the geometry envelope already contains the origin, 
 * the translation procedure cannot be applied.  
 * In this case, the common bits value is computed as zero.
 * <p>
 * If the geometry crosses the Y axis but not the X axis 
 * (and <i>mutatis mutandum</i>), 
 * the common bits for Y are zero, 
 * but the common bits for X are non-zero.
