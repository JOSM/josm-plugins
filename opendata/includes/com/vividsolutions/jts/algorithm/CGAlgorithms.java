  	 * MD - 9 Aug 2010
  	 * It seems that the basic algorithm is slightly orientation dependent,
  	 * when computing the orientation of a point very close to a line.
  	 * This is possibly due to the arithmetic in the translation to the origin.
  	 * 
  	 * For instance, the following situation produces identical results 
  	 * in spite of the inverse orientation of the line segment:
  	 * 
  	 * Coordinate p0 = new Coordinate(219.3649559090992, 140.84159161824724);
  	 * Coordinate p1 = new Coordinate(168.9018919682399, -5.713787599646864);
  	 * 
  	 * Coordinate p = new Coordinate(186.80814046338352, 46.28973405831556);
  	 * int orient = orientationIndex(p0, p1, p);
  	 * int orientInv = orientationIndex(p1, p0, p);

  	 * A way to force consistent results is to normalize the orientation of the vector
  	 * using the following code.
  	 * However, this may make the results of orientationIndex inconsistent
  	 * through the triangle of points, so it's not clear this is 
  	 * an appropriate patch.
  	 *
