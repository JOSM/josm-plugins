/**
 * MonotoneChains are a way of partitioning the segments of an edge to
 * allow for fast searching of intersections.
 * Specifically, a sequence of contiguous line segments
 * is a monotone chain iff all the vectors defined by the oriented segments
 * lies in the same quadrant.
 * <p>
 * Monotone Chains have the following useful properties:
 * <ol>
 * <li>the segments within a monotone chain will never intersect each other
 * <li>the envelope of any contiguous subset of the segments in a monotone chain
 * is simply the envelope of the endpoints of the subset.
 * </ol>
 * Property 1 means that there is no need to test pairs of segments from within
 * the same monotone chain for intersection.
 * Property 2 allows
 * binary search to be used to find the intersection points of two monotone chains.
 * For many types of real-world data, these properties eliminate a large number of
 * segment comparisons, producing substantial speed gains.
 *
