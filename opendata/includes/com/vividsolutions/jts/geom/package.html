Contains the <CODE>Geometry</CODE> interface hierarchy and supporting classes.
<P>
The Java Topology Suite (JTS) is a Java API that implements a core set of spatial data operations using an explicit precision model and robust geometric algorithms. JTS is intended to be used in the development of applications that support the validation, cleaning, integration and querying of spatial datasets.
<P>
JTS attempts to implement the OpenGIS Simple Features Specification (SFS) as accurately as possible.  In some cases the SFS is unclear or omits a specification; in this case JTS attempts to choose a reasonable and consistent alternative.  Differences from and elaborations of the SFS are documented in this specification.
