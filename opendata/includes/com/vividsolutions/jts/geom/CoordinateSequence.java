/**
 * The internal representation of a list of coordinates inside a Geometry.
 * <p>
 * This allows Geometries to store their
 * points using something other than the JTS {@link Coordinate} class. 
 * For example, a storage-efficient implementation
 * might store coordinate sequences as an array of x's
 * and an array of y's. 
 * Or a custom coordinate class might support extra attributes like M-values.
 * <p>
 * Implementing a custom coordinate storage structure
 * requires implementing the {@link CoordinateSequence} and
 * {@link CoordinateSequenceFactory} interfaces. 
 * To use the custom CoordinateSequence, create a
 * new {@link GeometryFactory} parameterized by the CoordinateSequenceFactory
 * The {@link GeometryFactory} can then be used to create new {@link Geometry}s.
 * The new Geometries
 * will use the custom CoordinateSequence implementation.
 * <p>
 * For an example, see the code for
 * {@link ExtendedCoordinateExample}.
 *
 * @see CoordinateArraySequenceFactory
 * @see PackedCoordinateSequenceFactory
