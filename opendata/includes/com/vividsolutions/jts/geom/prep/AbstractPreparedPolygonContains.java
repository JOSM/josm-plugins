/**
 * A base class containing the logic for computes the <tt>contains</tt>
 * and <tt>covers</tt> spatial relationship predicates
 * for a {@link PreparedPolygon} relative to all other {@link Geometry} classes.
 * Uses short-circuit tests and indexing to improve performance. 
 * <p>
 * Contains and covers are very similar, and differ only in how certain
 * cases along the boundary are handled.  These cases require 
 * full topological evaluation to handle, so all the code in 
 * this class is common to both predicates.
 * <p>
 * It is not possible to short-circuit in all cases, in particular
 * in the case where line segments of the test geometry touches the polygon linework.
 * In this case full topology must be computed.
 * (However, if the test geometry consists of only points, this 
 * <i>can</i> be evaluated in an optimized fashion.
