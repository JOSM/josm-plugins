							<h2>ODC Open Database License (ODbL)</h2>

							<h3>Preamble</h3>

							<p>The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement
								intended to allow users to freely share, modify, and use this
								Database while maintaining this same freedom for others. Many
								databases are covered by copyright, and therefore this document
								licenses these rights. Some jurisdictions, mainly in the
								European Union, have specific rights that cover databases, and
								so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally, the ODbL is
								also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to act
								in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.</p>

							<p>Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content
								(images, audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same
								database, for example), and so the ODbL only governs the rights
								over the Database, and not the contents of the Database
								individually. Licensors should use the ODbL together with
								another license for the contents, if the contents have a single
								set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the
								contents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors
								should describe what rights govern what contents together in the
								individual record or in some other way that clarifies what
								rights apply.</p>

							<p>Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database
								itself, can be covered by other rights not addressed here (such
								as private contracts, trade mark over the name, or privacy
								rights / data protection rights over information in the
								contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult
								other documents or clear other rights before doing activities
								not covered by this License.</p>

							<hr>

							<p>The Licensor (as defined below)</p>

							<p>and</p>

							<p>You (as defined below)</p>

							<p>agree as follows:</p>

							<h3>1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words</h3>

							<p>“Collective Database” – Means this Database in unmodified
								form as part of a collection of independent databases in
								themselves that together are assembled into a collective whole.
								A work that constitutes a Collective Database will not be
								considered a Derivative Database.</p>

							<p>“Convey” – As a verb, means Using the Database, a
								Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective
								Database in any way that enables a Person to make or receive
								copies of the Database or a Derivative Database. Conveying does
								not include interaction with a user through a computer network,
								or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no transfer of a
								copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs. “Contents”
								– The contents of this Database, which includes the information,
								independent works, or other material collected into the
								Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be
								factual data or works such as images, audiovisual material,
								text, or sounds.</p>

							<p>“Database” – A collection of material (the Contents)
								arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually
								accessible by electronic or other means offered under the terms
								of this License.</p>

							<p>“Database Directive” – Means Directive 96/9/EC of the
								European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the
								legal protection of databases, as amended or succeeded.</p>

							<p>“Database Right” – Means rights resulting from the Chapter
								III (“sui generis”) rights in the Database Directive (as amended
								and as transposed by member states), which includes the
								Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part
								of the Contents, as well as any similar rights available in the
								relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4.</p>

							<p>“Derivative Database” – Means a database based upon the
								Database, and includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement,
								modification, or any other alteration of the Database or of a
								Substantial part of the Contents. This includes, but is not
								limited to, Extracting or Re-utilising the whole or a
								Substantial part of the Contents in a new Database.</p>

							<p>“Extraction” – Means the permanent or temporary transfer
								of all or a Substantial part of the Contents to another medium
								by any means or in any form.</p>

							<p>“License” – Means this license agreement and is both a
								license of rights such as copyright and Database Rights and an
								agreement in contract.</p>

							<p>“Licensor” – Means the Person that offers the Database
								under the terms of this License.</p>

							<p>“Person” – Means a natural or legal person or a body of
								persons corporate or incorporate.</p>

							<p>“Produced Work” – a work (such as an image, audiovisual
								material, text, or sounds) resulting from using the whole or a
								Substantial part of the Contents (via a search or other query)
								from this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as
								part of a Collective Database.</p>

							<p>“Publicly” – means to Persons other than You or under Your
								control by either more than 50% ownership or by the power to
								direct their activities (such as contracting with an independent
								consultant).</p>

							<p>“Re-utilisation” – means any form of making available to
								the public all or a Substantial part of the Contents by the
								distribution of copies, by renting, by online or other forms of
								transmission.</p>

							<p>“Substantial” – Means substantial in terms of quantity or
								quality or a combination of both. The repeated and systematic
								Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the
								Contents may amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a
								Substantial part of the Contents.</p>

							<p>“Use” – As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted
								by copyright or Database Rights whether in the original medium
								or any other; and includes without limitation distributing,
								copying, publicly performing, publicly displaying, and preparing
								derivative works of the Database, as well as modifying the
								Database as may be technically necessary to use it in a
								different mode or format.</p>

							<p>“You” – Means a Person exercising rights under this
								License who has not previously violated the terms of this
								License with respect to the Database, or who has received
								express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
								this License despite a previous violation.</p>

							<p>Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa.</p>

							<h3>2.0 What this License covers</h3>

							<p>2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. A license of applicable
								copyright and neighbouring rights;</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. A license of the
								Database Right; and</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. An agreement in contract
								between You and the Licensor.</p>

							<p>2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal
								rights in the Database, including:</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Copyright. Any copyright
								or neighbouring rights in the Database. The copyright licensed
								includes any individual elements of the Database, but does not
								cover the copyright over the Contents independent of this
								Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright law varies
								between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database
								model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and
								organisation of the Database, and can also include the Database
								tables and table indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and
								the Field names of Contents stored in the Database;</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Database Rights.
								Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and Re-utilisation
								of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents. Database
								Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Database. Database Rights can
								also apply when the Contents are removed from the Database and
								are selected and arranged in a way that would not infringe any
								applicable copyright; and</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Contract. This is an
								agreement between You and the Licensor for access to the
								Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of use on
								this access as outlined in this License.</p>

							<p>2.3 Rights not covered.</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. This License does not
								apply to computer programs used in the making or operation of
								the Database;</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. This License does not
								cover any patents over the Contents or the Database; and</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. This License does not
								cover any trademarks associated with the
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Database.</p>

							<p>2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The
								individual items of the Contents contained in this Database may
								be covered by other rights, including copyright, patent, data
								protection, privacy, or personality rights, and this License
								does not cover any rights (other than Database Rights or in
								contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database. For
								example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this
								License would not apply to copyright over individual images,
								which could have their own separate licenses, or one single
								license covering all of the rights over the images.</p>

							<h3>3.0 Rights granted</h3>

							<p>3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
								the Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free,
								non-exclusive, terminable (but only under Section 9) license to
								Use the Database for the duration of any applicable copyright
								and Database Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial
								use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent
								possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be
								exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created
								in the future.</p>

							<p>The rights granted cover, for example:</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Extraction and
								Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the
								Contents;</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Creation of Derivative
								Databases;</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Creation of Collective
								Databases;</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Creation of temporary or
								permanent reproductions by any means and in any form, in whole
								or in part, including of any Derivative Databases or as a part
								of Collective Databases; and</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Distribution,
								communication, display, lending, making available, or
								performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole
								or in part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of
								Collective &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Databases.</p>

							<p>3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of
								doubt:</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Non-waivable compulsory
								license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to
								collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
								scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
								right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the
								rights granted under this License;</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Waivable compulsory
								license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to
								collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
								scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to
								collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
								granted under this License; and,</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Voluntary license
								schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
								whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
								member of a collecting society that administers voluntary
								licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of
								the rights granted under this License.</p>

							<p>3.3 The right to release the Database under different
								terms, or to stop distributing or making available the Database,
								is reserved. Note that this Database may be multiple-licensed,
								and so You may have the choice of using alternative licenses for
								this Database. Subject to Section 10.4, all other rights not
								expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.</p>

							<h3>4.0 Conditions of Use</h3>

							<p>4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly
								made subject to Your complying with the following conditions of
								use. These are important conditions of this License, and if You
								fail to follow them, You will be in material breach of its
								terms.</p>

							<p>4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any
								Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective
								Database, then You must:</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Do so only under the
								terms of this License or another license permitted under Section
								4.4;</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Include a copy of this
								License (or, as applicable, a license permitted under Section
								4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) with the Database
								or Derivative Database, including both in the Database or
								Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Keep intact any
								copyright or Database Right notices and notices that refer to
								this License.</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. If it is not possible to
								put the required notices in a particular file due to its
								structure, then You must include the notices in a location (such
								as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to look for
								it.</p>

							<p>4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using
								a Produced Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2.
								However, if you Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a
								notice associated with the Produced Work reasonably calculated
								to make any Person that uses, views, accesses, interacts with,
								or is otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that Content
								was obtained from the Database, Derivative Database, or the
								Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it is
								available under this License.</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Example notice. The
								following text will satisfy notice under Section 4.3:</p>

							<pre>
								<code>    Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available
    here under the Open Database License (ODbL).
</code>
							</pre>

							<p>DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the
								Database and a hyperlink to the URI of the Database. “Open
								Database License” should contain a hyperlink to the URI of the
								text of this License. If hyperlinks are not possible, You should
								include the plain text of the required URI’s with the above
								notice.</p>

							<p>4.4 Share alike.</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Any Derivative Database
								that You Publicly Use must be only under the terms of:</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								i. This License;</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this
								License; or</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								iii. A compatible license.</p>

							<p>If You license the Derivative Database under one of the
								licenses mentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of
								that license.</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. For the avoidance of
								doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the whole or a
								Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a
								Derivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4.</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Derivative Databases and
								Produced Works. A Derivative Database is Publicly Used and so
								must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work created from
								the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Share Alike and
								additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt, You must not
								add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a that
								are incompatible with the rights granted under this License.</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Compatible licenses.
								Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine compatible licenses
								under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the authorised proxy’s
								public statement of acceptance of a compatible license grants
								You permission to use the compatible license.</p>

							<p>4.5 Limits of Share Alike. The requirements of Section 4.4
								do not apply in the following:</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. For the avoidance of
								doubt, You are not required to license Collective Databases
								under this License if You incorporate this Database or a
								Derivative Database in the collection, but this License still
								applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of
								the Collective Database;</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Using this Database, a
								Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a Collective
								Database to create a Produced Work does not create a Derivative
								Database for purposes of Section 4.4; and</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Use of a Derivative
								Database internally within an organisation is not to the public
								and therefore does not fall under the requirements of Section
								4.4.</p>

							<p>4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a
								Derivative Database or a Produced Work from a Derivative
								Database, You must also offer to recipients of the Derivative
								Database or Produced Work a copy in a machine readable form of:</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The entire Derivative
								Database; or</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. A file containing all of
								the alterations made to the Database or the method of making the
								alterations to the Database (such as an algorithm), including
								any additional Contents, that make up all the differences
								between the Database and the Derivative Database.</p>

							<p>The Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file
								(under b.) must be available at no more than a reasonable
								production cost for physical distributions and free of charge if
								distributed over the internet.</p>

							<p>4.7 Technological measures and additional terms</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. This License does not
								allow You to impose (except subject to Section 4.7 b.) any terms
								or any technological measures on the Database, a Derivative
								Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents
								that alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any rights
								granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting
								the ability of any person to exercise those rights.</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Parallel distribution.
								You may impose terms or technological measures on the Database,
								a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of the
								Contents (a “Restricted Database”) in contravention of Section
								4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of the Database or a
								Derivative Database available to the recipient of the Restricted
								Database:</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								i. That is available without additional fee;</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								ii. That is available in a medium that does not alter or
								restrict the terms of this License, or any rights granted under
								it, or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of
								any person to exercise those rights (an “Unrestricted
								Database”); and</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the
								recipient as a practical matter as the Restricted Database.</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. For the avoidance of
								doubt, You may place this Database or a Derivative Database in
								an authenticated environment, behind a password, or within a
								similar access control scheme provided that You do not alter or
								restrict the terms of this License or any rights granted under
								it or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of
								any person to exercise those rights.</p>

							<p>4.8 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the
								Database. Each time You communicate the Database, the whole or
								Substantial part of the Contents, or any Derivative Database to
								anyone else in any way, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
								license to the Database on the same terms and conditions as this
								License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
								third parties with this License, but You may enforce any rights
								that You have over a Derivative Database. You are solely
								responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made
								by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose
								any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted
								or affirmed under this License.</p>

							<h3>5.0 Moral rights</h3>

							<p>5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights,
								including any rights to be identified as the author of the
								Database or to object to treatment that would otherwise
								prejudice the author’s honour and reputation, or any other
								derogatory treatment:</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. For jurisdictions
								allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives all moral
								rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest
								extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under
								Section &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.4;</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. If waiver of moral
								rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant jurisdiction is not
								possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over
								the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the
								fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction
								under Section 10.4; and</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. For jurisdictions not
								allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral rights under
								Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights
								over certain aspects of the Database.</p>

							<p>Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the
								waiver of moral rights, and so moral rights may still subsist
								over the Database in some jurisdictions.</p>

							<h3>6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights
								not affected</h3>

							<p>6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or
								anyone else may independently have under any applicable law to
								make any use of this Database, including without limitation:</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Exceptions to the
								Database Right including: Extraction of Contents from
								non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for
								purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research,
								and Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an
								administrative or judicial procedure.</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Fair dealing, fair use,
								or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to
								infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.</p>

							<p>6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful
								users to Extract and Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the
								Contents, evaluated quantitatively or qualitatively, for any
								purposes whatsoever, including creating a Derivative Database
								(subject to other rights over the Contents, see Section 2.4).
								The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of
								insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount to the
								Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the
								Contents.</p>

							<h3>7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer</h3>

							<p>7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor “as is” and
								without any warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or
								arising by statute, custom, course of dealing, or trade usage.
								Licensor specifically disclaims any and all implied warranties
								or conditions of title, non-infringement, accuracy or
								completeness, the presence or absence of errors, fitness for a
								particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise. Some
								jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties,
								so this exclusion may not apply to You.</p>

							<h3>8.0 Limitation of liability</h3>

							<p>8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or
								limited by law, the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly
								excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and whenever
								caused to anyone by any use under this License, whether by You
								or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part
								of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of liability includes,
								but is not limited to, any special, incidental, consequential,
								punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue, data,
								anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies
								even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
								damages.</p>

							<p>8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited
								to actual and direct financial loss to the extent it is caused
								by proved negligence on the part of the Licensor.</p>

							<h3>9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License</h3>

							<p>9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this
								License automatically terminates this License with immediate
								effect and without notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt,
								Persons who have received the Database, the whole or a
								Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative Databases, or the
								Database as part of a Collective Database from You under this
								License will not have their licenses terminated provided their
								use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted
								under Section 4.8 of this License. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10
								will survive any termination of this License.</p>

							<p>9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License,
								the Licensor will not terminate Your rights under it.</p>

							<p>9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is
								granted to You for the duration of applicable rights in the
								Database.</p>

							<p>9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of
								the terms and conditions of this License, then your full rights
								under this License will be reinstated:</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Provisionally and
								subject to permanent termination until the 60th day after
								cessation of breach;</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Permanently on the 60th
								day after cessation of breach unless otherwise reasonably
								notified by the Licensor; or</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Permanently if
								reasonably notified by the Licensor of the violation, this is
								the first time You have received notice of violation of this
								License from the Licensor, and You cure the violation prior to
								30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p>

							<p>Persons subject to permanent termination of rights are not
								eligible to be a recipient and receive a license under Section
								4.8.</p>

							<p>9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right
								to release the Database under different license terms or to stop
								distributing or making available the Database. Releasing the
								Database under different license terms or stopping the
								distribution of the Database will not withdraw this License (or
								any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
								under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
								in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.</p>

							<h3>10.0 General</h3>

							<p>10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be
								invalid or unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or
								enforceability of the remainder of the terms and conditions of
								this License and each remaining provision of this License shall
								be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>

							<p>10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the
								parties with respect to the rights granted here over the
								Database. It replaces any earlier understandings, agreements or
								representations with respect to the Database.</p>

							<p>10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License,
								You will not be entitled to rely on the terms of this License or
								to complain of any breach by the Licensor.</p>

							<p>10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will
								be governed by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which
								the License terms are sought to be enforced. If the standard
								suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law and
								Database Rights in the relevant jurisdiction includes additional
								rights not granted under this License, these additional rights
								are granted in this License in order to meet the terms of this
								License.</p>
