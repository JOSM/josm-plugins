This is the Ultimate WMS Turbo Challenge II game, it is used for
recording GPX traces and/or mapping roads (TODO) based on a WMS layer
such as Yahoo! aerial imagery.  The WMS source needs to be detailed
enough for roads to be visible.

If you never recorded GPS traces in a car, now you have a chance to
do so in an environmentally friendly way.  Note that mapping railways
or waterways is not supported due to shortage of 4-colour '90s style
train and motorboat bitmaps.
